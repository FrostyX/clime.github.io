COPR SCM
========

Prolog
------

Do you have your RPM package sources placed in a publicly available Git or SVN repo? Would you like to build them in the most easiest way 
and even automate that process? Then this article is exactly for you.

Ok, you have my ear
-------------------

Cool! Well, maybe you have already heard about [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org) build system. This is where we will be doing our
setup to automatically rebuild your packages. Why there? Because this is the place to make your work public, or if you don't want that yet,
just to test it and share the built rpm binaries with other developers. The linked COPR instance is part of Fedora Project but COPR source
code itself (https://pagure.io/copr/copr) is not bound to a particular distribution.

Simple Howto
------------

So let's dive into it. Let's say you have your repo hosted on Github as me here: https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked and
you want to make an installable RPM package out of it. First you need login and create a COPR project dedicated for building packages
out of your repo(s). If you haven't done it before, follow instructions [here](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/). Otherwise, let's 
jump to the building part:

    1) Go to your created project page
    2) Click on **Builds**
    3) Click on **New build** and select **SCM** tab
    4) Insert <your project url> into **Clone URL:** field
    5) Click on blue **Build** button at the bottom
